Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the VSDS in accurately detecting stress levels in speech, with promising performance metrics including precision, recall, and F1-score. Furthermore, the system's robustness was assessed through cross-validation and testing on unseen data, exhibiting consistent performance across different contexts and speaker demographics.
The detection of deception has been a crucial area of interest across various domains, including law enforcement, security, and psychological research. In recent years, technological advancements have led to the exploration of automated systems for deception detection. This paper presents the development of a Voice Stress Detection System (VSDS) aimed at identifying stress indicators in speech associated with deception.
Stress detection systems represent a burgeoning field of research with profound implications for healthcare, well-being, and performance optimization. The ability to accurately assess and monitor stress levels in real-time holds immense potential for enhancing individuals' resilience, productivity, and overall quality of life. In this context, establishing clear objectives for stress detection systems is paramount to guide research efforts, inform technological development, and facilitate the translation of scientific knowledge into practical applications.
